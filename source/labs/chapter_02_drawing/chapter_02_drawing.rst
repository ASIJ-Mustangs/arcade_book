Lab 2: Draw a Picture
=====================

Your assignment: Draw a pretty picture. The goal of this lab is to get practice
using functions to draw, and introduce computer graphics.

To get full credit:

* You must use multiple colors.
* You must have a coherent picture.
  I am not interested in abstract art with random shapes.
* You must use multiple types of graphic functions
  (e.g. circles, rectangles, lines, etc.)

To select new colors use:

http://www.colorpicker.com/

Copy the values for Red, Green, and Blue.
Do not worry about colors for hue, Saturation, or Brilliance.

Please use comments and blank lines to make it easy to follow your program.
If you have 5 lines that draw a robot, group them together with blank lines
above and below. Then add a comment at the top telling the reader what you
are drawing.

Looking for ideas? At the page below, each time you refresh the page I show
various images created by students from prior years:

Also, here is an example program that shows you what I'm looking for:
