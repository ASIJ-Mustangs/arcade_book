Lab 1: First Program
====================

1. If you are installing on your own computer, install Python and set up the libraries. See :ref:`installing-python`.
2. If you are installing on your own computer, install PyCharm. See :ref:`installing-pycharm`.
3. If you are installing on your own computer, install Git. See :ref:`installing-git`.
4. If you are installing on your own computer, install SourceTree. See :ref:`installing-sourcetree`.
5. Fork the repository. See :ref:`fork-repository`.
6. Share the repository. See :ref:`share-repository`.
7. Clone the repository. :ref:`clone-repository`.
8. Create and run a test program that prints ``Hello``. See :ref:`print-hello-world`.
9. Commit and push the updated program to BitBucket. See :ref:`first-commit`.
10. Update your program to print something longer. Commit and push again. See :ref:`print-multiple-lines`.
11. Examine and try out different **escape codes**. See :ref:`escape-codes`.
12. Now make the lab *yours*. Figure out something of your own to print. Don't just use my examples. Make it longer
    than one line. At least four. Also include at least one escape code.
13. Commit and push your lab.
14. Find your lab in in BitBucket. Go to "source" and find the directory it is in. Copy the URL, submit for grading.

Before turning in your program, double-check:

* Did you remove the sample prints shown above, and make up your own print
  statements? At least four lines?
* Did you invite your instructor to the repository?
* Does the program use proper spelling, capitalization, and grammar in the text that
  you printed to the screen?
* Does the program use at least one escape code?
* Hover over the PyCharm "hints" that are on the right side of your editor to
  see if there are suggestions on how to make your code better.

Copy the URL and turn it in via Scholar and you are done!
