Lab 1: First Program
====================

1. If you are installing on your own computer, install Python and set up the libraries. See :ref:`installing-python`.
2. If you are installing on your own computer, install PyCharm. See :ref:`installing-pycharm`.
3. If you are installing on your own computer, install Git. See :ref:`installing-git`.
4. Fork the repository. See :ref:`fork-repository`.
5. Share the repository. See :ref:`share-repository`.
6. Clone the repository. :ref:`clone-repository`.
7. Create and run a test program that prints ``Hello``. See :ref:`print-hello-world`.
8. Commit and push the updated program to BitBucket. See :ref:`commit`.
9. Update your program to print something longer. Commit and push again. See :ref:`print-multiple-lines`.
10. Examine and try out different **escape codes**. See :ref:`escape-codes`.
11. Now is the time to work on Lab 01. Make sure you are working in the Lab 01 folder, with the ``lab_01.py`` file.
12. Make the lab *yours*. Figure out something of your own to print. Don't just use my examples. Make it longer
    than one line. At least four. Also include at least one escape code.
13. Try running your lab. If you see the old "test" program running instead, right click on your program and tell it
    you want it to run ``lab_01.py`` not the other program.
14. Commit and push your lab.
15. Find your lab in in BitBucket. Go to "source" and find the directory it is in. Copy the URL, submit for grading.

Before turning in your program, double-check:

* Did you put the code in ``lab_01.py`` in the Lab 1 folder?
* Did you remove the sample prints shown above, and make up your own print
  statements? At least four lines?
* Did you invite your instructor to the repository?
* Does the program use proper spelling, capitalization, and grammar in the text that
  you printed to the screen? (Seriously, make sure what you print out has periods and capital letters.)
* Does the program use at least one escape code? Also, remember you don't have to put spaces around escape
  codes. So do this: ``"\tIndented with a tab"`` not ``"\t Indented with a tab"`` because the space after the
  t isn't needed unless you want both a tab and an extra space.
* Hover over the PyCharm "hints" that are on the right side of your editor to
  see if there are suggestions on how to make your code better.
* Can you find the code in BitBucket?
* Have you copied the URL and turned it in to Scholar? (Find the Lab 01 link on Scholar.)

Congratulations, you are done!
