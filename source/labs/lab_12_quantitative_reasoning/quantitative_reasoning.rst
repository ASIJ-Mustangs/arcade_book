Quantitative Reasoning Reflection
=================================

This is a reflection on quantitative reasoning. However, instead of turning it
in via a PDF or MS Word document, we'll turn it in as a text document.

Directions
----------

* Create a directory in your project called ``Quantitative Reasoning Reflection``.
* Inside that directory, create a new file called ``reflection.txt``. Don't create
  it as a Python file, because this isn't a Python program.
* In PyCharm, under the "File" menu, select "Settings...". Then find "Editor"
  and under that "Code Style." By default you could see a column guide set at
  120 characters. Set this to 80 for now.
* Add your name, date, and a title to the document. Failure to do this is a
  three point penalty.
* Don't write text beyond the 80 character limit. (Occasionally hitting 85
  isn't a big deal, but if you write 800 characters on a line, expect to
  get penalized.
* Answer each question below. Commit and turn in just like a regular program.
  Use complete sentences and proper spelling. Label each question. Put a blank
  line between each question.

Questions
---------

Each question is worth five points. Make sure you have five good points as part
of your answer. I'd suggest drafting out five points, and then fill in the
points with proper sentences, grammar, and punctuation. Examples are encouraged.

1. Describe how you used multiple methods to add functionality to your program.
   For example, how did you use lists? "If" statements? Loops? Classes? Functions?
   Sample pieces of code?
   How did you decide which methods to apply? Feel free to give examples.
2. Explain how you communicate your solution (from one programmer to another)
   when writing the code. Show how
   variable names matter, how function names matter, how comments and structure
   make your code easier to read.
3. How did you test and evaluate the accuracy of your code? When something didn't
   work, describe how you figured out what the error was. Also, how do you determine
   if data returned is correct data?
4. What are the limitations to using numerical methods to make decisions? What
   limits did you notice when you programmed item placement or non-player
   characters?
