Quantitative Reasoning Reflection
=================================

Answer each question. Use the template that is part of PyCharm project. Commit
and turn in just like a regular program.

Each question is worth five points. Make sure you have five good points as part
of your answer.

You can answer the question correctly, but only give one point worth of
information, therefore only get one point.

1. Describe how you used multiple methods to add functionality to your program.
   For example, how did you use lists? "If" statements? Loops? Classes? Functions?
   Sample pieces of code?
   How did you decide which methods to apply?
2. Explain how you communicate your solution when writing the code. Show how
   variable names matter, how function names matter, how comments and structure
   make your code easier to read.
3. How did you test and evaluate the accuracy of your code? When something didn't
   work, describe how you figured out what the error was.
4. What are the limitations to using numerical methods to make decisions? What
   limits did you notice when you programmed item placement or non-player
   characters?
