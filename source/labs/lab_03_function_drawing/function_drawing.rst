Requirements for Drawing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can update your program from Lab 2, or create a new program. This lab is worth
20 points. See the point breakdown below.

Incorporate the following items:

* Find the folder for Lab 03 in PyCharm. Feel free to use any code from Lab 02 you want, just
  copy it across.
* Follow the instructions in :ref:`make-everything-a-function`.
* Make sure you have a ``main()`` function
* Create three functions that draw something. (15 pts total, up to 5 pts
  per function)

  * Define the function and successfully call it. (1 pt)
  * Make your drawing function complex. 0 points for a one-line function that
    just draws a rectangle, 0 points for copying the example from the book,
    2 points for a cohesive multi-line function. (2 pts)
  * Pass in ``x`` and ``y`` parameters and successfully position the object
    as shown in :ref:`custom-drawing-function`. (2 pts)

Drawing with functions is worth 16 points. You can get the final 4 points by animating your image.


Requirements for Animation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Animate an object. The movement does not need to be complex. See :ref:`animate-drawing` for
an example.
