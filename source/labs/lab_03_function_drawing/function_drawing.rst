Lab 3: Drawing with Functions
=============================

Draw and animate an image.
Update your program from Lab 2, or create a new program. Lab is worth
20 points, see the breakdown below.

Incorporate the following items:

* Start with the same PyCharm project you used for Lab 01 and Lab 02. Create a
  new folder for Lab 03. Feel free to use any code from Lab 02 you want, just
  copy it across. Do not create a new repository. Do not create a new code
  branch. Just create a directory for Lab 3. Make sure it is not inside of th
  folders for Lab 01 or Lab 02.
* Create three functions that draw something. (15 pts total, up to 5 pts
  per function)

  * Define the function and successfully call it. (1 pt)
  * Make your drawing function complex. 0 points for a one-line function that
    just draws a rectangle, 0 points for copying the example from the book,
    2 points for a cohesive multi-line function. (2 pts)
  * Pass in ``x`` and ``y`` parameters and successfully position the object. (2 pts)

* Properly use the ``main`` function for your main program as shown
  in :ref:`make-everything-a-function`. (1 pt)
* Animate the object as shown in this
  `bouncing rectangle example`_. (4 pts)
