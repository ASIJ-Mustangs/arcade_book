Lab 9: Sprites and Walls
========================

Goal: Create a landscape of wall objects that the user must navigate around to
collect coins. This will help practice using ``for`` loops to create
and position multiple items.

* Step 1: Start with the move with walls example. Use either the scrolling or
  non-scrolling example.
* Step 2: Create a more complex arrangement of walls. Make sure the walls don't
  allow the user to go off-screen. 6 points, based on how complex the
  arrangement.
* Step 3: Update the graphics. Use multiple types of blocks for the walls. Maybe
  change the character. 4 points, one point for each graphic used that wasn't
  part of the base example.
* Step 4: Add coins for the user to collect. 4 points, based on the complexity
  of the coin layout.
* Step 5: Keep score of how many coins were collected, and display on-screen.
  4 points.
* Step 6: Add a sound to play each time the user collects a coin. 2 points.
