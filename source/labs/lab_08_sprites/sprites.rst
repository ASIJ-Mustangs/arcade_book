==============

.. image:: lab_8.gif

* Create a player-character sprite. Feel free to pick your own image for the
  sprite.
* Allow the user to move the player move by the keyboard, mouse, or game pad.
  Your choice. If you use the mouse, make sure you hide it.
* Create "good" sprites. Pick your own image for the sprite.
* Create "bad" sprites. Pick your own image for the sprite.
* For each good sprite collected, make the score go up. Optionally, play a 'good' sound.
* For each bad sprite touched, have the score go down. Optionally, play a 'bad' sound.
* Animate/move the good sprites. Pick any of the motions we showed, or make your
  one.
* Move the bad sprites. Move them differently than the good ones.
* If the length of the good sprite list is zero, then don't move any of the
  sprites or the character. "Freeze" the game.
* If the length of the good sprite list is zero, draw "Game Over" on the screen.
* Double-check on-line that the images for your sprites uploaded. Upload sounds.
* Triple-check on-line that everything uploaded. If the images and sounds aren't uploaded, it can't be graded.
* Turn in a URL to your project.
