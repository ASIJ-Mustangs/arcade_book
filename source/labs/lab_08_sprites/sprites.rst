Lab 8: Sprites
==============

* Create a player-character sprite. Feel free to pick your own image for the
  sprite.
* Allow the user to move the player move by the keyboard, mouse, or game pad.
  Your choice.
* Create "good" sprites. Pick your own image for the sprite.
* Create "bad" sprites. Pick your own image for the sprite.
* For each good sprite collected, make the score go up.
* For each bad sprite touched, have the score go down.
* Animate/move the good sprites. Pick any of the motions we showed, or make your
  one.
* Move the bad sprites. Move them differently than the good ones.
* If the length of the good sprite list is zero, then don't move any of the
  sprites or the character. "Freeze" the game.
* If the length of the good sprite list is zero, draw "Game Over" on the screen.
