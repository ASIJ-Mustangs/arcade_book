Drawing with Functions
======================

The goal of this chapter is to learn how to create our own functions to draw.
We don't want to be stuck with just ``draw_circle`` commands.
We want to be able to define create our own ``draw_tree`` or ``draw_house``
commands.

To do this we need to learn three new skills:

* How to define a function
* How to use variables
* How to create simple mathematical expressions
