Understanding and setting up your system
========================================

Before you begin, you need to install a few things on the computer that you
are working on. If you are using a school computer, you may have these already
installed, but you still need to understand what has been installed.

You need:

* The Python language
* The Arcade library
* An editor to type in your programs


What is a programming language?
-------------------------------

Computers have a Central Processing Unit (CPU) that are the main "brains" of the
computer.

The CPU gets its instructions by reading a set of numbers. For example
the number "04" might be an instruction to add two other numbers together.
So some numbers were data, and some were computer instructions.

In the early days of computing, this is how people coded programs.

We call these numbers that are instructions **machine code**. Note that not
all numbers are machine code, but machine code is made of numbers.
Machine code is also called a **First Generation Language** (1GL).

Computers still
run on machine code. You can still code this way if you want, although you'd
be crazy because hand-coding these numbers is tedious. In order to make things
easier, computer scientists came up with something called **assembly language**.
Assembly language is a **second generation language** (2GL).

Assembly language allows a programmer to edit a file and type in ``LDA`` which
stands for "Load Accumulator Immediate." The programmer types these commands
into a **source file**. We call the commands **source code**. The computer
can't run the source code as-is. The programmer runs a **compiler** that
simply translates the computer commands like ``LDA`` into the number of the
machine language instruction.
