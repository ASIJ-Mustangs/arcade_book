Classes, Animation and User Control
===================================

We can use a class to represent our program.
The Arcade library has a built-in class that represents a window on the
screen. We can create our own child class and override functions to handle:

* Start-up and initialization
* Drawing the items on our screen
* Animating/Updating the positions of items on our screen
* Responding to the keyboard
* Responding to the mouse

One of the best ways of learning to program, is to look at sample code. This
chapter has several examples designed to learn how to:

* Open a window using an object-oriented approach
* Animating objects
* Moving objects with the mouse
* Moving objects with the keyboard
* Moving objects with the joystick
